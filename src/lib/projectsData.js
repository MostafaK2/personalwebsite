On the backend, springboot facilitates server-side development, while MySql is the database for storing chat and user data. \n Real-time bidirectional communication is established through WebSockets in Spring Boot, implemented using libraries like SockJS and STOMP. Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The entire application is configured to run on the same port, and Docker ensures consistent deployment across various environments.",
